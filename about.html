		<span>Our specialist area of study and in service work is in Religious and Moral Education.   We find that the aspect of Religious and Moral Education that is usually at the centre of debate, and prominent in the concerns of teachers, education authorities and parents, is the question of how classroom teaching can bring about personal change in young people.   It is expressed in terms such as promoting their faith development, deepening their spirituality, inculcating moral values, changing their attitudes, instilling a sense of religious identity and improving their Mass attendance.</span>

		<span>A school is an educational institution design to provide learning space and learning environments for the teaching of students (or “pupils”) under the directions of teachers. The ultimate aim of education/teaching and learning is to cause change in behavior of a learner. A teacher is a person who assists others in gaining knowledge, value and competence. Religious Education (RE) is a subject taught at primary and secondary levels that aims to develop children's understanding of the world's religions. Through religious education, children will learn about different religions and their traditions, practices and beliefs. </span>
